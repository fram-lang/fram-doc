# Lexical Structure

## Whitespace

The following characters are considered as whitespace (blanks): horizontal tab
(`0x09`), new line (`0x10`), vertical tab (`0x11`), form feed (`0x12`),
carriage return (`0x13`), and space (`0x20`). Whitespace characters are ignored
by the lexer, but they separate tokens, e.g., identifiers or literals.
